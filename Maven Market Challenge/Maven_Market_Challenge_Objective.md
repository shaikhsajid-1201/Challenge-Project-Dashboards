2.  On which day of the week does volume tend to be highest? Lowest?
3.  On which date did Amazon (AMZN) see the most volatility, measured by the difference between the high and low price?
4.  If you could go back in time and invest in one stock from 1/2/2014 - 12/29/2017, which would you choose? What % gain would you realize?
